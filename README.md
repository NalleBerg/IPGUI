This is just a simple Graphic userinterface for ipconfig. It will show the most importnt IP addresses with a possibility for 
«Advanced» mode showinw «ipconfig /all» in the window.

It is also capable of refreshing the IP address via DHCP.

If you are not on internet you will get a warning, so it speeds up troubleshooting.

Future plans:

This application is finished!

I might work on it later, but I have no plans as of now. This is a program that does one thing only - handle the IP address.
